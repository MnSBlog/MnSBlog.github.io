: Question
Hi, I have some problem about reporting when EoS.
In Arena, We could see a report to check KPI using Crystal report about 6 months ago.
But I tried to reisntall Arena of latest version, and simulated same model.

I checked reporting message, clicked "yes", I can see report on Excel (.xmls)
My machine installed Crystal report in Arena installation folder, I want to switch report background module(Excel <-> Crystal report)
Please tell me about switching report mode.

Hello, Customer care team member.
You said you need detailed information such as screenshots or URL to understand my problem.

1. Set model
I made just simple model(It doesn't matter to you and me)

2. End of the simulation
I can show a message about reporting this model.
I clicked "예(Y)" means "Yes"

3. Report
Beginning Excel program; Show report about this model.
**But I want to show the report using the Crystal report too. because I am used to analyzing values on the Crystal report.**
I know Rockwell changes report making method for some reasons. I'll try to apply these update contents. however I want I can switch reporting option.

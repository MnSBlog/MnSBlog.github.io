# Modeling & Simulaation Lab

 M&S Lab deals with the modeling of simulation of various systems including manufacturing systems (semiconductor, LCD, automobile and ship building industries), and weapon systems for defense. Currently, M&S Lab running multiple projects with major manufactures (DSME, HanKook Tire, Hyundai/Kia Motors, LG CNS) as well as the Agency for Defense Development (ADD) of Korea. Graduate students in the M&S Lab. can join various projects which they want to be involved.
